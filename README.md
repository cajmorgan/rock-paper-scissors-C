A terminal based "Rock, Paper & Scissors" game I made to learn C, ncurses and try out some AI algorithms. Both One and Two player support (from same computer, will implement online 2 player support in the future). If you play against the computer (AI) it will try to learn how you play. As RPS is best played completely random, that's not what tends to happen when playing against a friend IRL. The algorithm for the AI is implemented to mimic a good real life strategy, but it would probably play better with only random moves against a player that plays 100% random, though it will have a good chance to beat you if you choose to play similar moves. The AI always keeps some kind of randomness to the moves it chooses. 

Enjoy!
